Matrix multiplication tests.

  Number of processors available = 4
  Number of threads              = 4

Matrix multiplication timing.
  A(LxN) = B(LxM) * C(MxN).
  L = 1000
  M = 1000
  N = 1000
  Floating point OPS roughly 2000000000
  Elapsed time dT = 0.152197
  Rate = MegaOPS/dT = 13140.852903

omp_mm:
  Normal end of execution.
