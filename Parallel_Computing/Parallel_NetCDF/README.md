* Example1: Parallel NetCDF - write 2D data, a 6 x 12 grid, on 4 processors. Each processor will write it's rank to it's quarter of the array.
* Example2: Parallel NetCDF - write 2D data, 10 x 10 array, on 10 processors. Each processor will write a row of the array.
* Example3: Parallel NetCDF - read 2D array created in **Example2** with 10 processors .
